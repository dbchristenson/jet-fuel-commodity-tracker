    "prediction": "**The Bottom Line**\nThe market outlook for US distillates is **Bullish** for the upcoming week, as strengthening spot price momentum and optimized refinery feedstock access suggest prices will continue their upward trajectory.\n\n**Key Drivers**\n*   **Price Momentum:** US Gulf Coast (RGC) Ultra-Low Sulfur Diesel (ULSD) spot prices surged 5% in early January, rising from $1.946 to $2.043 per gallon. Jet fuel followed a similar path, gaining approximately 2.3% to reach $1.953/gal.\n*   **Venezuelan Crude Integration:** The influx of Venezuelan \"heavy\" crude is a significant tailwind for PADD 3 refiners, who currently produce 2.8 million barrels of distillate per day. This feedstock is highly lucrative for US complex refining configurations, likely supporting high utilization rates.\n*   **Trade Volatility:** Protectionist rhetoric regarding the decertification of Bombardier jets and potential trade friction with Canada introduces uncertainty into the aerospace sector but may paradoxically tighten regional supply chains.\n*   **Military Demand:** Persistent geopolitical tensions, evidenced by F-16 groundings in Taiwan and active combat losses of Su-25s in Ukraine, maintain a high baseline for military-grade kerosene demand.\n\n**Risk Factors**\n*   **Trade Retaliation:** Escalating disputes with Canada could impact cross-border energy flows or critical refining components.\n*   **Logistical Weather Delays:** Erratic atmospheric patterns and heavy rainfall in key regions could temporarily suppress trucking and construction-related diesel demand.\n*   **Peak Demand Sentiment:** Growing market narratives regarding peak oil demand may cap long-term gains if refinery production outpaces consumption.",
