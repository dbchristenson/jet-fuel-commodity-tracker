    "prediction": "**The Bottom Line**\nThe outlook for the coming week is **Bullish**, as rising geopolitical risk premiums in the Middle East and the strategic reintegration of Venezuelan heavy crude into Gulf Coast refineries support a price floor for distillates.\n\n**Key Drivers**\n*   **Price Momentum:** US Gulf Coast (PADD 3) spot prices demonstrated significant strength in the first full week of January. Ultra-Low Sulfur Diesel (ULSD) climbed from $1.946 to $2.016/gal, while Jet Fuel surged nearly 5% from $1.821 to $1.909/gal.\n*   **Geopolitical Friction:** Yemen\u2019s separatist movement and the resulting escalation between Saudi Arabia and the UAE have reintroduced a supply-side risk premium. Combined with lost contact with military aircraft in Libya, regional instability remains a primary driver for volatility.\n*   **Feedstock Optimization:** Analyst reports indicate that access to Venezuelan heavy crude is \"tremendous news\" for US Gulf Coast refiners. PADD 3, which produces approximately 2.8 million barrels of distillate per day, is uniquely equipped to process these heavy grades, likely improving distillate yields and refinery margins.\n*   **Aviation Expansion:** United Airlines\u2019 investment in JetZero\u2019s \"all-wing\" aircraft and the unveiling of new luxury routes from SFO signal sustained long-term confidence in kerosene-type jet fuel demand despite broader economic concerns.\n\n**Risk Factors**\n*   **Demand Peaks:** There is growing concern that falling global oil prices and a looming peak in demand may complicate the exploitation of new heavy crude reserves.\n*   **Weather Variability:** The sudden cessation of California\u2019s atmospheric storms may reduce localized diesel demand for transit and infrastructure recovery.\n*   **Regulatory Uncertainty:** The merging of governance and \"content creation\" within the administration adds a layer of unpredictability to energy policy communication.",
