    "prediction": "**Market Outlook: US Distillates**\n\n**The Bottom Line**\nThe outlook for US distillates is **bearish** for the coming week, as spot prices face downward pressure and trade-related friction weighs on aviation demand sentiment.\n\n**Key Drivers**\n*   **Price Compression:** US Gulf Coast (RGC) spot prices for Ultra-Low Sulfur Diesel (ULSD) fell from $2.209/gal on January 21 to $2.179/gal by January 26. Jet fuel followed a steeper downward trajectory, dropping to $2.064/gal as market participants reacted to softening near-term demand.\n*   **Refining Feedstock Optimism:** Renewed focus on Venezuelan \"heavy\" crude\u2014viewed as \"tremendous news\" for PADD 3 refiners\u2014suggests a potential long-term increase in distillate yields. PADD 3 currently produces 2,800 MBBL/D of distillate fuel oil, and increased access to heavy crude could further bolster supply.\n*   **Aviation Sector Headwinds:** The administration\u2019s threat to decertify Bombardier Global Express business jets, alongside high-profile fleet groundings (Taiwan F-16s) and recent fatal private jet crashes, has introduced regulatory and safety-related uncertainty into the jet fuel market.\n*   **Stable Production:** October data confirms robust output, with U.S. refinery net production of distillate fuel oil at 4,782 MBBL/D, keeping inventories sufficiently cushioned against seasonal volatility.\n\n**Risk Factors**\n*   **Trade Policy Volatility:** Escalating threats against Canadian aviation manufacturers could disrupt cross-border fuel logistics and corporate flight activity.\n*   **Geopolitical Supply Shocks:** Ongoing combat losses of Su-25 aircraft in Ukraine and shifting defense postures in Europe (Denmark retiring F-16 fleets) could suddenly tighten global middle distillate balances if regional tensions escalate further.",
