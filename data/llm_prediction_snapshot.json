    "prediction": "### **The Bottom Line**\nThe outlook for US distillates is **Bullish** for the coming week, as spot price momentum in the Gulf Coast and geopolitical supply uncertainties outweigh long-term bearish demand narratives.\n\n### **Key Drivers**\n*   **Upward Price Momentum:** Gulf Coast spot prices for Kerosene-Type Jet Fuel rose 2.3% between January 9 and January 12, climbing from $1.909 to $1.953/gal. Ultra-Low Sulfur Diesel (ULSD) followed a similar trajectory, breaching the $2.04/gal mark, signaling tightening immediate-term availability.\n*   **Refinery Feedstock Optimism:** Renewed focus on Venezuelan heavy crude is a significant tailwind for PADD 3 refiners. Given that the Gulf Coast accounts for roughly 52% of total U.S. jet fuel production (~868 MBBL/D), access to these specific \"heavy\" grades is critical for optimizing distillate yields and maintaining the current 2,800 MBBL/D output.\n*   **Trade Friction:** Presidential threats to decertify Bombardier Global Express jets in a dispute with Canada introduce regulatory volatility. This friction could disrupt cross-border business aviation, though the immediate market impact has been speculative rather than structural.\n\n### **Risk Factors**\n*   **Political Theater:** While \"unleashing\" Venezuelan oil is a primary narrative, actual flow increases depend on infrastructure and sanctions relief, which may not materialize fast enough to offset seasonal demand.\n*   **Safety & Operational Disruptions:** Recent private jet crashes and military groundings (Taiwan F-16s) present localized demand shocks, while potential trade wars with aerospace allies could dampen long-term jet fuel consumption forecasts.",
