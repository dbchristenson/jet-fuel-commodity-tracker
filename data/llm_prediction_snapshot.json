    "prediction": "**Market Outlook: US Distillates**\n\n**The Bottom Line**\nThe outlook for US distillates is **Bullish** for the coming week, with prices expected to trend higher as geopolitical risk premiums and regional supply disruptions outweigh seasonal demand fluctuations.\n\n**Key Drivers**\n*   **Geopolitical Risk Premium:** Tensions in the Middle East ahead of U.S.-Iran negotiations in Oman, combined with reports of Russian stealth aircraft moving into North Africa, are providing significant upward pressure on energy benchmarks.\n*   **Bullish Price Momentum:** Gulf Coast (RGC) spot prices have shown aggressive gains in late February. Kerosene-type jet fuel jumped 7.5% from $2.311 to $2.485/gal between February 18 and 23, while Ultra-Low Sulfur Diesel (ULSD) climbed from $2.478 to $2.570/gal in just three days.\n*   **Logistical Disruptions:** Severe weather on the U.S. East Coast\u2014the worst in decades\u2014has grounded civilian aircraft and likely disrupted terminal deliveries, creating localized supply tightness.\n*   **Trade Friction:** President Trump\u2019s recent threats to decertify Bombardier aircraft and pressure India to swap Russian oil for Venezuelan crude introduce new volatility into global trade flows and refinery feedstock slates.\n\n**Risk Factors**\n*   **Diplomatic Breakthroughs:** A successful outcome in the Oman talks could rapidly deflate the current Middle East war premium.\n*   **Inventory Levels:** While refinery production was robust at 5.2 million bbl/d (distillates) in late 2025, any significant inventory builds reported in the upcoming EIA data could temper the current price rally.\n*   **Weather Normalization:** As East Coast weather clears, the resumption of standard flight schedules will test the depth of current jet fuel inventories.",
