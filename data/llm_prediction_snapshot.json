    "prediction": "**The Bottom Line**\nThe outlook for US distillates is **Bullish** for the coming week, with prices expected to trend higher as escalating geopolitical risk premiums and strengthening spot market momentum outweigh current refinery production levels.\n\n**Key Drivers**\n*   **Spot Price Momentum:** US Gulf Coast (RGC) Jet Fuel prices have shown significant strength, climbing over 3% from $2.095 on Feb 5 to $2.165 per gallon on Feb 9. Low-sulfur diesel has also firmed to $2.135, indicating robust immediate demand.\n*   **Geopolitical Friction:** A direct military encounter\u2014the US shoot-down of an Iranian drone in the Arabian Sea\u2014and \"last-ditch\" negotiations in Oman have significantly heightened the risk premium for energy products. \n*   **Regional Supply Tightness:** Reports of jet fuel exhaustion in Cuba and shifting trade flows under the Trump administration\u2019s push to redirect Venezuelan \"heavy\" crude to US refiners suggest a restructuring of the Atlantic Basin supply chain that favors US distillate margins.\n*   **Refinery Yield Potential:** While refinery production of distillates remains steady (5,210 MBBL/D as of the latest consolidated data), the pivot toward Venezuelan heavy oil is a strategic long-term positive for Gulf Coast refiners optimized for higher distillate yields.\n\n**Risk Factors**\n*   **Trade Volatility:** Threatened sanctions on North African nations regarding Russian military deals and aircraft decertification disputes with Canada could disrupt broader aerospace demand.\n*   **Economic Headwinds:** If diplomatic efforts in the Middle East unexpectedly succeed, a rapid deflation of the current risk premium could see prices retract toward the $2.10 level.",
