            "summary": "Sydney, 26 February (Argus) — Australian carrier Qantas reported today that its July-December 2025 fuel costs were 3pc up on the year in its half-year results, but growth was less than capacity additions for the period. Qantas' fuel expense for July-December 2025 was A$2.61bn ($1.86bn), slightly above its A$2.6bn guidance and up from A$2.54bn a year earlier . But jet fuel prices were more favourable, leading to a net benefit for the airline, the firm said in its half-year report released on 26 February. The figure was 2pc below the A$2.67bn reported in July-December 2023. The company expects its jet fuel expenditure to total about $A5.11bn for the year ending 30 June 2026, up from A$5bn in 2024-25 , based on consumption of about 89,500 b/d and a price of A$125/bl. The forecast excludes hedging, into-plane costs, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) premiums and carbon credit costs. Qantas' jet fuel consumption for July-December was about 88,000 b/d, up from 85,000 b/d a year earlier. SAF purchases were 20mn litres, with Qantas expecting to meet a 1pc SAF target in 2025-26. Most of Qantas' SAF refuelling has been at Los Angeles airport in the US, where SAF prices are typically the lowest. (See graph) Qantas is also involved in the SAF-focused fund Saffa, which last month pledged to invest in Dubai-based sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) developer SAF One's planned Middle East plant, with first output expected in late 2028. The company's July-December profit after tax was A$925mn, up from A$923mn in the prior corresponding period, while revenue rose to A$12.9bn from A$12.1bn a year earlier. Earnings were supported by growth in the carrier's more efficient Airbus A321F fleet, which Qantas said has increased its payload capacity and reduced fuel use.

            "title": "US proposes wide-ranging foreign vessel fees",
            "summary": "New York, 17 February (Argus) — The US is proposing fees on cargo carried into the US by foreign-built vessels, an effort to boost the US shipbuilding industry that could substantially increase costs for US importers. The administration's America's Maritime Action Plan released late last week proposes fees of between 1-25¢/kilogram (kg), or effectively $10-$250/tonne (t), for all cargo imported into the US by non-US built vessels, which make up the vast majority of the global fleet across all commodity segments. The plan does not specify cargo types and describes the fee as \"universal\". This could mean shipments of Venezuelan crude loaded onto an Aframax tanker into the US Gulf coast carried on a foreign-built vessel could incur a fee between $700,000 lumpsum at $10/t or $17.5mn at $250/t. The freight rate for an Aframax tanker on a Caribbean-US Gulf coast voyage was at $32.57/t on 16 February, or $2,279,900 lumpsum. The proposed fee could be as much as 30pc of the total freight cost at the low end or increase the freight cost by nearly eight times at the high end. The proposed fees could be used to build a proposed Maritime Security Trust Fund to support \"programs identified as helpful for the promotion, growth and strengthening of the domestic maritime sector\", according to the plan. The fund is part of a broader plan the administration of President Donald Trump launched last year to support shipbuilding in the US. The US and China reached an agreement in November 2025 to pause new shipping fees which ended a months-long series of proposed, and shortly implemented, retaliatory shipping fees between the two countries. The pause was for at least one year, making additional shipping fees into the US before November 2026 unlikely. The plan released last week does not include any specific timelines for implementing fees. Autonomous vessels on tap The 37-page action plan also said the US needs to develop systems and regulations for non-human-staffed ships to navigate existing waterways. \"To ease testing for industry, the US Coast Guard should establish one or more areas within the exclusive economic zone of the US, to include the Great Lakes region, that would allow for the safe and expedited testing of commercial robotic and autonomous maritime technologies,\" the plan says. The testing would help the US Navy develop emerging technologies to field affordable weapon platforms, like remotely operated or fully automated submarines and small vessels, to balance high-cost assets like aircraft carriers in battle. But the action plan also lays out plans that suggest the administration is preparing for fully automated commercial shipping. Automated shipping lacks the regulatory framework to account for the absence of a human crew, especially for emergencies like spills. Insurers also have no framework for how to decide who is responsible for a collision with an unmanned vessel, among a host of other issues, according to the action plan. Pilots, who climb onto ships outside of ports in sometimes dangerous conditions to physically guide the vessel to its terminal, seem the most likely industry to be first affected by autonomous navigation systems like those proposed in the action plan. There is a need to develop \"redundant sensor systems to guarantee safe navigation in complex environments like ports\", the plan said, language likely referring to tasks now handled by human pilots. The plan also calls for the development and certification of control centers for remote operators, as well as \"ensuring safe workloads when operators may supervise multiple vessels from shore\".

            "title": "Mexico jet fuel changes to raise costs unevenly",
            "summary": "Mexico City, 9 February (Argus) — Mexican state-owned Airports and Auxiliary Services (ASA) will overhaul its jet fuel discount structure from mid-February, a move market participants say will raise fuel logistics costs unevenly across the aviation market. ASA notified fuel buyers in mid-January that it will revise the volume thresholds required to access discounts on its jet fuel administrative service charge (CSAC), which applies to storage and into-plane services, beginning 15 February, with a more aggressive second phase taking effect on 1 July, according to documents seen by Argus . While the changes do not involve a headline increase in jet fuel prices, they will materially alter effective operating costs by limiting access to discounts for all but the highest-volume buyers. The changes disproportionately affect airlines and jet fuel buyers outside Mexico's three largest carriers. Under the revised structure, participants outside of the top-volume tiers would see their CSAC discounts cut sharply, while a narrow group of top-tier buyers would retain access to materially higher discounts, market participants said. Mexico's jet fuel market remains dominated by the government through state-owned Pemex and ASA, which together control fuel supply, storage and into-plane services at most airports nationwide. The CSAC, introduced in July 2024 , applies to all companies using ASA's fuel storage and into-plane infrastructure, making it a mandatory cost for all jet fuel suppliers and buyers operating at Mexican airports. This structure amplifies the impact of the revised CSAC scheme, as companies have no practical alternatives for jet fuel logistics. The changes could reinforce concentration further down the value chain by favoring a limited group of high-volume buyers, effectively creating a new commercial bottleneck beneath the state-controlled infrastructure layer, according to market sources. The issue has been raised with the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which confirmed it is engaging with ASA over the revised CSAC structure. \"IATA is in contact with ASA on this subject and is advocating on behalf of the industry to ensure that the impact on costs is kept as competitive as possible,\" the association said in a statement to Argus . ASA did not respond to a request for comment. Discount curve shifts sharply from Feb Under the current CSAC discount structure, differences across market participants are relatively narrow, but the gap will widen sharply under the first phase of changes in mid-February. Most jet fuel buyers — including large foreign airlines and private-sector jet fuel suppliers — currently receive discounts ranging from 85-98pc, while the largest buyers qualify for discounts of 99pc, resulting in broadly comparable costs across much of the market. But from 15 February, discount tiers will tighten, with participants outside the highest volume threshold seeing their discounts fall to around 40pc, while top-tier buyers will retain discounts of 90pc, according to market sources and documents seen by Argus . The gap widens further under the second phase, effective 1 July. From July, participants that do not meet the highest volume threshold will receive discounts as low as 20pc, while top-tier buyers will continue to qualify for discounts of 80pc. This would translate into effective CSAC costs up to four times higher for all participants outside the largest buyers. The companies falling into the lower discount tiers include large foreign airlines, private-sector jet fuel suppliers, regional airlines and private aviation. Market sources said the revised structure marks a clear difference from the previous model, in which discount gaps existed but remained manageable. Under the new framework, the discount disparity is big enough to create a structural cost disadvantage for some participants. Regional aviation under pressure The revised CSAC structure could threaten the viability of regional aviation, as higher fuel logistics costs would further strain an already fragile segment of Mexico's aviation market, according to market sources. Regional airlines operate short-haul routes with limited ability to pass higher costs through to fares, making them particularly sensitive to increases in fuel logistics charges. The revised discount thresholds would sharply erode route economics, a source familiar with regional airline operations said. The impact could even extend to state-owned airline Mexicana de Aviacion , which does not meet the volume thresholds required to access the highest CSAC discounts.

            "title": "US naphtha displaces Russian flows to Venezuela",
            "summary": "New York, 28 January (Argus) — Naphtha shipments to Venezuela loading in January have come entirely from US Gulf coast suppliers, reversing the previous Russia-dominated trade for the diluent needed to transport Venezuelan crude after US intervention. Ports in Houston, Beaumont and Corpus Christi, Texas, have shipped between 970,000-1.22mn bl of naphtha to Venezuela so far this month, according to Kpler and Vortexa data, compared to 560,000-1.21mn bl for the last three months of 2025, when Chevron was the only oil major with a US government waiver to trade with Venezuela. Vitol has joined commodity trader Trafigura in this naphtha trade, after the US physically removed Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro from power and cracked down on sanctioned vessel shipments to and from the country, cutting the primarily Russian flow of the diluent to Venezuela. Since 2023 Venezuela has been the importer for the majority of Caribbean-bound naphtha, and was typically the second-largest buyer of US Gulf coast naphtha, before the US government removed sanctions waivers in May 2025. Buyers in the country primarily import naphtha on long range 1 (LR1) tankers, while the US Gulf coast spot market for refined product shipments is typically dominated by medium range (MR) tankers. Rising Venezuelan demand could spur additional LR1 demand from the US Gulf coast, which primarily trades as a backhaul for more liquid LR1 markets in deeper Pacific basin ports, especially for Mideast Gulf loadings. This could also affect the MR tanker market as other Caribbean naphtha buyers look to stock up ahead of further Venezuelan demand. Chevron sought an MR tanker for a US Gulf coast-Caribbean voyage on 27 January to load naphtha between 30 January and 1 February. A charterer later fixed at least one Caribbean-bound MR tanker at a $900,000 lumpsum on the same day, a 44pc jump in the voyage rate from the $625,000 lumpsum at the end of the trading day on 23 January. It is unclear if the second cargo was naphtha or another refined product. Naphtha spot participants unimpressed A swift rise in N+A naphtha prices on the US Gulf coast opened the arbitrage to the region, following the new supply agreement between the US and Venezuela. Differentials for heavy naphtha, the primary grade use as a Venezuelan diluent, shot up by more than 10¢/USG just before the first US naphtha shipment in early January. By mid-January, N+A naphtha differentials gave up all the gains. Selling interest for US Gulf coast naphtha diminished following the open arbitrage, potentially setting a precedent that sellers wanted to avoid in an already long market. A cargo of naphtha from Huelva, Spain, was booked for the US Gulf coast on 13 January with an estimated arrival of 3 February, shipping reports show. This supported the view that the naphtha arbitrage to the US Gulf coast was open. The Huelva cargo was reportedly suitable for blending to the Venezuelan diluent naphtha specification, but this was not confirmed. The Venezuelan diluent naphtha specification was roughly gauged as 70pc heavy naphtha and about 20-30pc lighter naphtha. Increased Venezuelan production in the longer run is not entirely bullish for US naphtha markets. Before Venezuelan production slowed during the regime of former president Hugo Chavez, Venezuela actively exported light naphtha from Jose and Las Salinas, primarily to the US Atlantic coast. Increased Venezuelan rates would also elevate naphtha production, which could diminish appetite for US naphtha imports and displace US naphtha market share globally.

            "full_text": "Market: Biofuels, Oil products\n28/01/26\n\nNaphtha shipments to Venezuela loading in January have come entirely from US Gulf coast suppliers, reversing the previous Russia-dominated trade for the diluent needed to transport Venezuelan crude after US intervention.\n\nPorts in Houston, Beaumont and Corpus Christi, Texas, have shipped between 970,000-1.22mn bl of naphtha to Venezuela so far this month, according to Kpler and Vortexa data, compared to 560,000-1.21mn bl for the last three months of 2025, when Chevron was the only oil major with a US government waiver to trade with Venezuela.\n\nVitol has joined commodity trader Trafigura in this naphtha trade, after the US physically removed Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro from power and cracked down on sanctioned vessel shipments to and from the country, cutting the primarily Russian flow of the diluent to Venezuela.\n\nSince 2023 Venezuela has been the importer for the majority of Caribbean-bound naphtha, and was typically the second-largest buyer of US Gulf coast naphtha, before the US government removed sanctions waivers in May 2025. Buyers in the country primarily import naphtha on long range 1 (LR1) tankers, while the US Gulf coast spot market for refined product shipments is typically dominated by medium range (MR) tankers.\n\nRising Venezuelan demand could spur additional LR1 demand from the US Gulf coast, which primarily trades as a backhaul for more liquid LR1 markets in deeper Pacific basin ports, especially for Mideast Gulf loadings. This could also affect the MR tanker market as other Caribbean naphtha buyers look to stock up ahead of further Venezuelan demand.\n\nChevron sought an MR tanker for a US Gulf coast-Caribbean voyage on 27 January to load naphtha between 30 January and 1 February. A charterer later fixed at least one Caribbean-bound MR tanker at a $900,000 lumpsum on the same day, a 44pc jump in the voyage rate from the $625,000 lumpsum at the end of the trading day on 23 January. It is unclear if the second cargo was naphtha or another refined product.\n\nA swift rise in N+A naphtha prices on the US Gulf coast opened the arbitrage to the region, following the new supply agreement between the US and Venezuela. Differentials for heavy naphtha, the primary grade use as a Venezuelan diluent, shot up by more than 10¢/USG just before the first US naphtha shipment in early January.\n\nBy mid-January, N+A naphtha differentials gave up all the gains. Selling interest for US Gulf coast naphtha diminished following the open arbitrage, potentially setting a precedent that sellers wanted to avoid in an already long market.\n\nA cargo of naphtha from Huelva, Spain, was booked for the US Gulf coast on 13 January with an estimated arrival of 3 February, shipping reports show. This supported the view that the naphtha arbitrage to the US Gulf coast was open.\n\nThe Huelva cargo was reportedly suitable for blending to the Venezuelan diluent naphtha specification, but this was not confirmed. The Venezuelan diluent naphtha specification was roughly gauged as 70pc heavy naphtha and about 20-30pc lighter naphtha.\n\nIncreased Venezuelan production in the longer run is not entirely bullish for US naphtha markets. Before Venezuelan production slowed during the regime of former president Hugo Chavez, Venezuela actively exported light naphtha from Jose and Las Salinas, primarily to the US Atlantic coast.\n\nIncreased Venezuelan rates would also elevate naphtha production, which could diminish appetite for US naphtha imports and displace US naphtha market share globally.\n\nBy Ross Griffith and Daphne Tan",

Front-month Ice January gasoil futures fell to a 25¢/t discount to the second-month February futures by the market close today, falling from a 50¢/t premium the day before. The European diesel market was last in contango — where prompt prices are lower than forward prices — in October 2024. The backwardated structure in futures — where prompt prices are higher than forward prices — narrowed steadily from early December, after reaching a peak in mid-November. Strong supply has weighed on the value of front-month futures this year, particularly from high imports expected from the US, according to one European analyst. Around 450,000t of diesel and other gasoil departed the US for Europe in the week to 2 January, and a further 525,000t has departed since then, according to Vortexa. Both volumes were the highest on the route since June last year. About 1.86mn t unloaded in the EU and UK from the Middle East in December, a seven-month high. The well-supplied market has come at a seasonally low period for regional diesel demand — January and February are normally the weakest months for European road fuel demand. January futures expire on 12 January, which may have also driven the front-month value down, according to a European trader. Traders closing their long positions in January futures before expiry would weigh on prices. The second-month and third-month futures remain backwardated, with February futures settling at a $2.50/t premium to March.

The outright value of the front-month contract and the backwardated futures structure peaked in mid-November, when supply was tightened by a mixture of low amounts on the water heading to Europe and sanctions-related disruption to supply. European imports have since recovered to higher levels. But the main driver behind the falling outright values and narrowing structure is probably seasonally weak demand.

European diesel demand faces further pressure this year from Germany's adoption of the EU's Renewable Energies Directive (RED III), which will adjust the greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction quota and abolish double counting of advanced fuels. To reach the adjusted GHG quota, refineries will probably increase the biofuel content blended with diesel, reducing demand for the latter.

A disconnect between diesel prices and fundamentals has continued into this year, with the market mostly driven by geopolitical news and sentiment, according to a European trader.

            "summary": "London, 6 January (Argus) — Supply-side uncertainties are likely to keep European jet fuel prices turbulent in 2026, with a much quieter outlook for demand. The European jet market in 2025 revealed a vulnerability to supply shocks, even to some that never fully materialised. Cif northwest Europe prices ranged between $622/t and $846/t, and refining margins between $14.60/bl and $41.40/bl. Oversupply in the summer , bolstered by profitable arbitrage economics from Asia-Pacific, pressed down on prices in August. By contrast, tighter supply in October-November boosted prices to some of the highest levels all year. Weaker refinery output in Europe and Asia-Pacific choked global supply, and east of Suez refiners favoured eastbound exports over Europe. The coming year could see similar supply-side fundamentals. The European refining industry is lacking spare capacity, after three permanent refinery closures in 2025. The recent closure of Phillips 66's 139,000 b/d Los Angeles refinery and the upcoming closure of Valero's 145,000 b/d Benecia refinery will tighten Californian supply, requiring transpacific imports. This could tighten the markets in Asia-Pacific that supplement Europe with jet when arbitrage is viable. European jet imports from China and India could become untenable if refiners there continue to process Russian crude, because of new EU sanctions that will ban import of refined products made from Russian grades in January. Even the unrealised threat of supply shocks rattled jet fuel prices in 2025. The brief conflict between Iran and Israel in June sent jet fuel prices to their highest since 2022. Talks regarding peace in Ukraine added yet more volatility as 2025 closed out. Jet fuel crack spreads rose to a two-year high and then fell to a five-week low within one week, even though there was no specific talk of relaxing sanctions and more sanctions are imminent. A return of east-west shipping to the Red Sea in 2026 could restrain jet price volatility. Jet fuel takes around two weeks quicker to arrive in Europe when sent through the Suez Canal than around the Cape of Good Hope, meaning imports could respond more quicker to supply shortfalls. Yemen-based Houthi militants indicated a pause to attacks on commercial vessels, although there has not yet been a mass return to the shorter route. Another calming influence on supply could be growing exports from Nigeria's 650,000 b/d Dangote refinery. The plant broke its monthly record for jet exports three times in 2025, according to Kpler. Although freight is costly from west Africa to Europe, Dangote could be well-placed to help relieve supply tightness in 2026. Bland demand European air travel is forecast to grow in 2026, but at a slower pace. Flight numbers are expected to rise by 3.1pc to 11.4mn in 2026, according to Eurocontrol data, after growing by 3.6pc in 2025. European air travel demand growth, in revenue passenger kilometres (RPK), will slow to 3.8pc in 2026 from 5pc in 2025, according to forecasts by the International Air Transport Association (Iata). Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandates and advancements in aircraft fuel efficiency will only drag slightly on fossil jet demand growth. The proportion of SAF mandated in EU jet blends will stay at 2pc and rise to around 4pc in the UK in 2026, so growth in SAF consumption does not yet appear significant enough to counterbalance overall demand growth. Longstanding issues in aircraft production keep thwarting fuel efficiency improvements . Iata expects the global fleet to become just 1pc more fuel efficient in 2025, only half of recent average annual efficiency gains. Fossil jet demand in north and central Europe and the Mediterranean will average 863,000 b/d in 2026, 1.2pc higher year-on-year, Argus Consulting predicts.

European air travel demand growth, in revenue passenger kilometres (RPK), will slow to 3.8pc in 2026 from 5pc in 2025, according to forecasts by the International Air Transport Association (Iata).\n\nSustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandates and advancements in aircraft fuel efficiency will only drag slightly on fossil jet demand growth. The proportion of SAF mandated in EU jet blends will stay at 2pc and rise to around 4pc in the UK in 2026, so growth in SAF consumption does not yet appear significant enough to counterbalance overall demand growth.\n\nLongstanding issues in aircraft production keep thwarting fuel efficiency improvements. Iata expects the global fleet to become just 1pc more fuel efficient in 2025, only half of recent average annual efficiency gains.\n\nFossil jet demand in north and central Europe and the Mediterranean will average 863,000 b/d in 2026, 1.2pc higher year-on-year, Argus Consulting predicts.\n\nBy Amaar Khan",

            "title": "Viewpoint: US jet fuel output seen rising with demand",
            "summary": "Houston, 31 December (Argus) — US jet fuel production could increase in line with airline demand in 2026 despite the Energy Information Administration's (EIA) projections of a production decrease due to biofuel blending policy for road fuels. The International Air Transport Association (Iata) expects global airline demand to increase in 2026, with global passenger volumes expected to reach 5.2bn, up by 4.4pc compared to 2025, while cargo volumes are expected to increase by 2.4pc to 71.6mn t. But the EIA reported in its December Short-Term Energy Outlook that 2026 jet fuel production will average 1.73mn b/d, down by 4.9pc compared to 2025estimated average, noting weakening demand in the next year. The agency expects the first quarter production to average 1.71mn b/d and the fourth quarter production at 1.68mn b/d, keeping the full-year production average down. But a number of factors — including continued use of less fuel-efficient jets and higher costs for meeting US road biofuel rules — should support US jet fuel production. Jet output is expected to keep pace with 2025 levels or higher, averaging 1.81mn b/d, Argus Consulting forecasts. Bottlenecks in the production of more fuel-efficient next-generation aircraft delayed the flow of new planes this past year, and are expected to worsen, limiting growth in the aviation section until at least the 2030s. Aircraft delivery delays from major manufacturers like Boeing have increased over the past year due to several factors, including tariffs on metals and electronics deriving from US-China trade tensions and engine production outpaced by airframes output. Costs around US biofuel blending obligations, particularly for distillates like biodiesel and renewable diesel, are also supportive of jet fuel production. Prices for D4 and D6 RINs, which reflect the cost of meeting Argus Renewable Volume Obligations (RVO) for biodiesel and ethanol, respectively, rose during 2025, from 9.45¢/USG on 2 January, cresting at 17.04¢/USG in June, before falling to roughly 15¢/USG for much of December. In June, the EPA proposed record-high blending targets in the biomass-based diesel category for the next two years — which will likely make compliance costs for those fuels even more expensive. But unlike road fuels such as gasoline and diesel, jet fuel is not bound by these blend mandates under the RFS. This means refiners looking to taper their blending obligations may retool production assets for more jet fuel and less diesel. A number of refiners are already making that pivot. Marathon Petroleum, one of the largest US independent refiners, is spending millions of dollars to increase jet fuel capacity at its 253,000 b/d Robinson, Illinois, refinery, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2026. US independent refiner HF Sinclair is also planning to boost jet fuel capacity at its 145,000 b/d Puget Sound refinery in Anacortes, Washington, to help serve the western US market, the company said in a third-quarter earnings call. CVR Energy started producing jet fuel at its 132,000 b/d Coffeyville, Kansas, refinery during the third quarter of 2025. Another independent refiner, Delek, has upgraded its 83,000 b/d El Dorado, Arkansas, refinery to produce jet fuel, the company said in May. The EIA does expect more demand for jet fuel in 2026. The product supplied projections for 2026 in the latest STEO was 1.74mn b/d, up by 0.6pc compared to 2025. But it still projects first quarter production to drop to 1.61mn b/d and fourth quarter to reach 1.72mn b/d, with second and third quarter projections higher at 1.82mn b/d and 1.81mn b/d, respectively. Originally expected to be finalized in late 2025, the EPA is set to confirm biofuel blending targets, as well as consider the reallocation of exempted volumes approved during 2025 in the first quarter of 2026 . Doing so would provide biofuel producers and obligated parties alike with a clearer view of expectations for 2026 and 2027. Unless biofuel production overshoots the thresholds for blending demand, or the EPA chooses not to reallocate a substantial volume of small refinery exemptions, market participants anticipate further continued strength for RIN prices. If these mandates do come to fruition and toughen the obligation refiners face for producing diesel, retooling and pivoting to a higher jet output would alleviate the added cost of producing finished road fuels.

            "title": "Viewpoint: Northeast diesel faces 2026 supply risks",
            "summary": "Houston, 30 December (Argus) — The US northeast diesel and heating oil market enters 2026 with lingering supply vulnerabilities despite recent improvements in flows. While imports of conventional fuels have resumed, structural constraints and global dynamics suggest that volatility will remain a defining feature in the coming years. Inventories of ultra-low sulphur diesel (ULSD) and ultra-low sulphur heating oil (ULSH) at the southern US Atlantic coast fell to the lowest level in more than 11-years this summer at 7.67mn bl. That pulled barrels sourced out of the US Gulf coast via the Colonial pipeline away from the line's final destination in the US northeast. New York Harbor's dependence on imports will persist due to limited refining capacity. While Canadian and Mexican flows improved late in 2025, upcoming refinery maintenance in Canada and operational uncertainties at Mexico's Olmeca refinery could disrupt supply in early 2026. Canadian refiner Suncor began 15 weeks of maintenance on 11 December at its 137,000 b/d Montreal refinery in Quebec, according to an announcement filed with Association industrielle de l'Est de Montreal, a near-term risk for US northeast markets. US imports from Canada nearly halved on the month in October, according to Vortexa ship-tracking data, partially caused by a turnaround at Irving Oil's 320,000 b/d St John refinery that ended in November. Following the turnaround, US Atlantic coast imports of ULSD and ULSH were 134,000 b/d, nearly double the level from a year earlier. Multiple cargoes came from Irving's St John refinery, according to Kpler ship-tracking data. But upcoming refinery work may once again come into play. Mexico's state-owned Pemex's 340,000 b/d Olmeca refinery recently resumed exports to the US after a near six-month period of zero loadings. Olmeca was initially highlighted as a crucial element in the Mexican government's strategy for road fuel self-sufficiency. But Pemex has also explored profitable ULSD export opportunities as local infrastructure has had difficulties absorbing the road fuel output from the Olmeca facility. Medium-range tanker BW Wren loaded around 300,000 bl of ULSD at the Dos Bocas port on 22 November and discharged throughout the southern US Atlantic coast, according to Kpler data. European diesel demand, amplified by sanctions on Russian products, kept open the US arbitrage to the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA) hub for much of 2025. If this trend continues, Gulf coast exports to Europe could again constrain diesel flows to the Atlantic coast. In the longer term, Nigeria's planned Dangote refinery expansion — scheduled for 2028 — may ease European demand for US barrels, but competition for supply will remain intense until then. Even though the US Atlantic coast remains heavily reliant on domestic and imported cargoes, the fungibility of diesel and heating oil grades provides leeway for sourcing these barrels. In mid-December, stockpiles of ULSD and ULSH at the central US Atlantic coast were down by 27pc on the year at 12.8mn bl, US Energy Information Administration data shows. Cash differentials that trade against the underlying Nymex basis — often a benchmark for regional demand — fell to 14-month and two-year lows during this period. Weaker demand for conventional diesel and heating oil in the New York region is partly driven by the growing availability and market share of B99 biodiesel. Three states across the northeast, including New York, are actively promoting biofuels adoption through legislative measures, tax incentives and infrastructure investments aimed at reducing emissions in heating systems and commercial transportation. The state of New York this year doubled its heating oil blend mandate to 10pc biodiesel (B10), while Connecticut and Rhode Island have similar B10 and B20 mandates, respectively. While biofuels help offset reduced inventories of conventional fuels, New York Harbor B99 biodiesel differentials to heating oil have traded at a premium for the first quarter 2026 because of feedstock and supply constraints, weaker credit incentives and policy uncertainty. Federal biofuel blending mandates for 2026 and 2027 remain unsettled, leading some producers to idle operations heading into the new year as they await clearer direction. In the short term, softer demand and renewed import flows suggest improved supply security for the US Atlantic coast. However, evolving federal policies and shifting global dynamics ensure that volatility will remain a hallmark of the region's diesel market.
