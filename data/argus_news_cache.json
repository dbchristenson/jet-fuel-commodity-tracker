            "summary": "New York, 28 January (Argus) — Naphtha shipments to Venezuela loading in January have come entirely from US Gulf coast suppliers, reversing the previous Russia-dominated trade for the diluent needed to transport Venezuelan crude after US intervention. Ports in Houston, Beaumont and Corpus Christi, Texas, have shipped between 970,000-1.22mn bl of naphtha to Venezuela so far this month, according to Kpler and Vortexa data, compared to 560,000-1.21mn bl for the last three months of 2025, when Chevron was the only oil major with a US government waiver to trade with Venezuela. Vitol has joined commodity trader Trafigura in this naphtha trade, after the US physically removed Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro from power and cracked down on sanctioned vessel shipments to and from the country, cutting the primarily Russian flow of the diluent to Venezuela. Since 2023 Venezuela has been the importer for the majority of Caribbean-bound naphtha, and was typically the second-largest buyer of US Gulf coast naphtha, before the US government removed sanctions waivers in May 2025. Buyers in the country primarily import naphtha on long range 1 (LR1) tankers, while the US Gulf coast spot market for refined product shipments is typically dominated by medium range (MR) tankers. Rising Venezuelan demand could spur additional LR1 demand from the US Gulf coast, which primarily trades as a backhaul for more liquid LR1 markets in deeper Pacific basin ports, especially for Mideast Gulf loadings. This could also affect the MR tanker market as other Caribbean naphtha buyers look to stock up ahead of further Venezuelan demand. Chevron sought an MR tanker for a US Gulf coast-Caribbean voyage on 27 January to load naphtha between 30 January and 1 February. A charterer later fixed at least one Caribbean-bound MR tanker at a $900,000 lumpsum on the same day, a 44pc jump in the voyage rate from the $625,000 lumpsum at the end of the trading day on 23 January. It is unclear if the second cargo was naphtha or another refined product. Naphtha spot participants unimpressed A swift rise in N+A naphtha prices on the US Gulf coast opened the arbitrage to the region, following the new supply agreement between the US and Venezuela. Differentials for heavy naphtha, the primary grade use as a Venezuelan diluent, shot up by more than 10¢/USG just before the first US naphtha shipment in early January. By mid-January, N+A naphtha differentials gave up all the gains. Selling interest for US Gulf coast naphtha diminished following the open arbitrage, potentially setting a precedent that sellers wanted to avoid in an already long market. A cargo of naphtha from Huelva, Spain, was booked for the US Gulf coast on 13 January with an estimated arrival of 3 February, shipping reports show. This supported the view that the naphtha arbitrage to the US Gulf coast was open. The Huelva cargo was reportedly suitable for blending to the Venezuelan diluent naphtha specification, but this was not confirmed. The Venezuelan diluent naphtha specification was roughly gauged as 70pc heavy naphtha and about 20-30pc lighter naphtha. Increased Venezuelan production in the longer run is not entirely bullish for US naphtha markets. Before Venezuelan production slowed during the regime of former president Hugo Chavez, Venezuela actively exported light naphtha from Jose and Las Salinas, primarily to the US Atlantic coast. Increased Venezuelan rates would also elevate naphtha production, which could diminish appetite for US naphtha imports and displace US naphtha market share globally.

The upgrade is planned to raise the refinery's capacity to 360,000 b/d from 260,000 b/d and added a new 90,000 b/d RFCC unit. Product quality will also improve from Euro 2 to Euro 5 standards.

            "summary": "London, 8 January (Argus) — The European diesel market has shifted into a contango structure for the first time in over a year, indicating that supply in the market is currently ample during a seasonally weak period for demand. Front-month Ice January gasoil futures fell to a 25¢/t discount to the second-month February futures by the market close today, falling from a 50¢/t premium the day before. The European diesel market was last in contango — where prompt prices are lower than forward prices — in October 2024. The backwardated structure in futures — where prompt prices are higher than forward prices — narrowed steadily from early December, after reaching a peak in mid-November. Strong supply has weighed on the value of front-month futures this year, particularly from high imports expected from the US, according to one European analyst. Around 450,000t of diesel and other gasoil departed the US for Europe in the week to 2 January, and a further 525,000t has departed since then, according to Vortexa. Both volumes were the highest on the route since June last year. About 1.86mn t unloaded in the EU and UK from the Middle East in December, a seven-month high. The well-supplied market has come at a seasonally low period for regional diesel demand — January and February are normally the weakest months for European road fuel demand. January futures expire on 12 January, which may have also driven the front-month value down, according to a European trader. Traders closing their long positions in January futures before expiry would weigh on prices. The second-month and third-month futures remain backwardated, with February futures settling at a $2.50/t premium to March.

            "summary": "London, 8 January (Argus) — Front-month Ice gasoil futures and the time spread between the front-month and second-month contracts both fell to the lowest in eight months at Wednesday's close, as the European diesel market enters its seasonally lowest period of demand. Ice January gasoil futures fell by $13.25/t on the day to $601/t on Wednesday, the lowest settlement price for the front-month contract since 30 May 2025. The January futures settled at a 50¢/t premium to the second-month February futures, the narrowest since 9 May. When prompt prices are greater than forward prices, it is known as backwardation. The outright value of the front-month contract and the backwardated futures structure peaked in mid-November, when supply was tightened by a mixture of low amounts on the water heading to Europe and sanctions-related disruption to supply. European imports have since recovered to higher levels. But the main driver behind the falling outright values and narrowing structure is probably seasonally weak demand. January and February are normally the weakest months for European road fuel consumption. EU diesel deliveries in January and February 2025 were around 5pc below those in December 2024, and almost 10pc lower than any of the other non-winter months in 2024, Eurostat data show. European diesel demand faces further pressure this year from Germany's adoption of the EU's Renewable Energies Directive (RED III), which will adjust the greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction quota and abolish double counting of advanced fuels. To reach the adjusted GHG quota, refineries will probably increase the biofuel content blended with diesel, reducing demand for the latter. Argus estimates at least 1mn t of fossil road fuel demand will be substituted by HVO in Germany this year, with most of that diesel. A disconnect between diesel prices and fundamentals has continued into this year, with the market mostly driven by geopolitical news and sentiment, according to a European trader. That could explain why the January futures' premium against the February contract has narrowed even with EU sanctions coming into force on 21 January that will will remove from the European market Indian and Turkish diesel refined from Russian crude, and with independent stocks of diesel and other gasoil at the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA) hub at a four-and-a-half-month low in the week to 31 December, according to consultancy Insights Global.

            "title": "Viewpoint: European jet faces supply-side threats",
            "summary": "London, 6 January (Argus) — Supply-side uncertainties are likely to keep European jet fuel prices turbulent in 2026, with a much quieter outlook for demand. The European jet market in 2025 revealed a vulnerability to supply shocks, even to some that never fully materialised. Cif northwest Europe prices ranged between $622/t and $846/t, and refining margins between $14.60/bl and $41.40/bl. Oversupply in the summer , bolstered by profitable arbitrage economics from Asia-Pacific, pressed down on prices in August. By contrast, tighter supply in October-November boosted prices to some of the highest levels all year. Weaker refinery output in Europe and Asia-Pacific choked global supply, and east of Suez refiners favoured eastbound exports over Europe. The coming year could see similar supply-side fundamentals. The European refining industry is lacking spare capacity, after three permanent refinery closures in 2025. The recent closure of Phillips 66's 139,000 b/d Los Angeles refinery and the upcoming closure of Valero's 145,000 b/d Benecia refinery will tighten Californian supply, requiring transpacific imports. This could tighten the markets in Asia-Pacific that supplement Europe with jet when arbitrage is viable. European jet imports from China and India could become untenable if refiners there continue to process Russian crude, because of new EU sanctions that will ban import of refined products made from Russian grades in January. Even the unrealised threat of supply shocks rattled jet fuel prices in 2025. The brief conflict between Iran and Israel in June sent jet fuel prices to their highest since 2022. Talks regarding peace in Ukraine added yet more volatility as 2025 closed out. Jet fuel crack spreads rose to a two-year high and then fell to a five-week low within one week, even though there was no specific talk of relaxing sanctions and more sanctions are imminent. A return of east-west shipping to the Red Sea in 2026 could restrain jet price volatility. Jet fuel takes around two weeks quicker to arrive in Europe when sent through the Suez Canal than around the Cape of Good Hope, meaning imports could respond more quicker to supply shortfalls. Yemen-based Houthi militants indicated a pause to attacks on commercial vessels, although there has not yet been a mass return to the shorter route. Another calming influence on supply could be growing exports from Nigeria's 650,000 b/d Dangote refinery. The plant broke its monthly record for jet exports three times in 2025, according to Kpler. Although freight is costly from west Africa to Europe, Dangote could be well-placed to help relieve supply tightness in 2026. Bland demand European air travel is forecast to grow in 2026, but at a slower pace. Flight numbers are expected to rise by 3.1pc to 11.4mn in 2026, according to Eurocontrol data, after growing by 3.6pc in 2025. European air travel demand growth, in revenue passenger kilometres (RPK), will slow to 3.8pc in 2026 from 5pc in 2025, according to forecasts by the International Air Transport Association (Iata). Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandates and advancements in aircraft fuel efficiency will only drag slightly on fossil jet demand growth. The proportion of SAF mandated in EU jet blends will stay at 2pc and rise to around 4pc in the UK in 2026, so growth in SAF consumption does not yet appear significant enough to counterbalance overall demand growth.

Iata expects the global fleet to become just 1pc more fuel efficient in 2025, only half of recent average annual efficiency gains.

            "full_text": "Market: Oil products\n06/01/26\n\nSupply-side uncertainties are likely to keep European jet fuel prices turbulent in 2026, with a much quieter outlook for demand.\n\nThe European jet market in 2025 revealed a vulnerability to supply shocks, even to some that never fully materialised. Cif northwest Europe prices ranged between $622/t and $846/t, and refining margins between $14.60/bl and $41.40/bl.\n\nOversupply in the summer, bolstered by profitable arbitrage economics from Asia-Pacific, pressed down on prices in August.\n\nBy contrast, tighter supply in October-November boosted prices to some of the highest levels all year. Weaker refinery output in Europe and Asia-Pacific choked global supply, and east of Suez refiners favoured eastbound exports over Europe.\n\nThe coming year could see similar supply-side fundamentals. The European refining industry is lacking spare capacity, after three permanent refinery closures in 2025.\n\nThe recent closure of Phillips 66's 139,000 b/d Los Angeles refinery and the upcoming closure of Valero's 145,000 b/d Benecia refinery will tighten Californian supply, requiring transpacific imports. This could tighten the markets in Asia-Pacific that supplement Europe with jet when arbitrage is viable. European jet imports from China and India could become untenable if refiners there continue to process Russian crude, because of new EU sanctions that will ban import of refined products made from Russian grades in January.\n\nEven the unrealised threat of supply shocks rattled jet fuel prices in 2025. The brief conflict between Iran and Israel in June sent jet fuel prices to their highest since 2022.\n\nTalks regarding peace in Ukraine added yet more volatility as 2025 closed out. Jet fuel crack spreads rose to a two-year high and then fell to a five-week low within one week, even though there was no specific talk of relaxing sanctions and more sanctions are imminent.\n\nA return of east-west shipping to the Red Sea in 2026 could restrain jet price volatility. Jet fuel takes around two weeks quicker to arrive in Europe when sent through the Suez Canal than around the Cape of Good Hope, meaning imports could respond more quicker to supply shortfalls. Yemen-based Houthi militants indicated a pause to attacks on commercial vessels, although there has not yet been a mass return to the shorter route.\n\nAnother calming influence on supply could be growing exports from Nigeria's 650,000 b/d Dangote refinery. The plant broke its monthly record for jet exports three times in 2025, according to Kpler. Although freight is costly from west Africa to Europe, Dangote could be well-placed to help relieve supply tightness in 2026.\n\nEuropean air travel is forecast to grow in 2026, but at a slower pace.\n\nFlight numbers are expected to rise by 3.1pc to 11.4mn in 2026, according to Eurocontrol data, after growing by 3.6pc in 2025. European air travel demand growth, in revenue passenger kilometres (RPK), will slow to 3.8pc in 2026 from 5pc in 2025, according to forecasts by the International Air Transport Association (Iata).\n\nSustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandates and advancements in aircraft fuel efficiency will only drag slightly on fossil jet demand growth. The proportion of SAF mandated in EU jet blends will stay at 2pc and rise to around 4pc in the UK in 2026, so growth in SAF consumption does not yet appear significant enough to counterbalance overall demand growth.\n\nLongstanding issues in aircraft production keep thwarting fuel efficiency improvements. Iata expects the global fleet to become just 1pc more fuel efficient in 2025, only half of recent average annual efficiency gains.\n\nFossil jet demand in north and central Europe and the Mediterranean will average 863,000 b/d in 2026, 1.2pc higher year-on-year, Argus Consulting predicts.\n\nBy Amaar Khan",

            "title": "Viewpoint: US jet fuel output seen rising with demand",
            "summary": "Houston, 31 December (Argus) — US jet fuel production could increase in line with airline demand in 2026 despite the Energy Information Administration's (EIA) projections of a production decrease due to biofuel blending policy for road fuels. The International Air Transport Association (Iata) expects global airline demand to increase in 2026, with global passenger volumes expected to reach 5.2bn, up by 4.4pc compared to 2025, while cargo volumes are expected to increase by 2.4pc to 71.6mn t. But the EIA reported in its December Short-Term Energy Outlook that 2026 jet fuel production will average 1.73mn b/d, down by 4.9pc compared to 2025estimated average, noting weakening demand in the next year. The agency expects the first quarter production to average 1.71mn b/d and the fourth quarter production at 1.68mn b/d, keeping the full-year production average down. But a number of factors — including continued use of less fuel-efficient jets and higher costs for meeting US road biofuel rules — should support US jet fuel production. Jet output is expected to keep pace with 2025 levels or higher, averaging 1.81mn b/d, Argus Consulting forecasts. Bottlenecks in the production of more fuel-efficient next-generation aircraft delayed the flow of new planes this past year, and are expected to worsen, limiting growth in the aviation section until at least the 2030s. Aircraft delivery delays from major manufacturers like Boeing have increased over the past year due to several factors, including tariffs on metals and electronics deriving from US-China trade tensions and engine production outpaced by airframes output. Costs around US biofuel blending obligations, particularly for distillates like biodiesel and renewable diesel, are also supportive of jet fuel production. Prices for D4 and D6 RINs, which reflect the cost of meeting Argus Renewable Volume Obligations (RVO) for biodiesel and ethanol, respectively, rose during 2025, from 9.45¢/USG on 2 January, cresting at 17.04¢/USG in June, before falling to roughly 15¢/USG for much of December. In June, the EPA proposed record-high blending targets in the biomass-based diesel category for the next two years — which will likely make compliance costs for those fuels even more expensive. But unlike road fuels such as gasoline and diesel, jet fuel is not bound by these blend mandates under the RFS. This means refiners looking to taper their blending obligations may retool production assets for more jet fuel and less diesel. A number of refiners are already making that pivot. Marathon Petroleum, one of the largest US independent refiners, is spending millions of dollars to increase jet fuel capacity at its 253,000 b/d Robinson, Illinois, refinery, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2026. US independent refiner HF Sinclair is also planning to boost jet fuel capacity at its 145,000 b/d Puget Sound refinery in Anacortes, Washington, to help serve the western US market, the company said in a third-quarter earnings call. CVR Energy started producing jet fuel at its 132,000 b/d Coffeyville, Kansas, refinery during the third quarter of 2025. Another independent refiner, Delek, has upgraded its 83,000 b/d El Dorado, Arkansas, refinery to produce jet fuel, the company said in May. The EIA does expect more demand for jet fuel in 2026. The product supplied projections for 2026 in the latest STEO was 1.74mn b/d, up by 0.6pc compared to 2025. But it still projects first quarter production to drop to 1.61mn b/d and fourth quarter to reach 1.72mn b/d, with second and third quarter projections higher at 1.82mn b/d and 1.81mn b/d, respectively. Originally expected to be finalized in late 2025, the EPA is set to confirm biofuel blending targets, as well as consider the reallocation of exempted volumes approved during 2025 in the first quarter of 2026 . Doing so would provide biofuel producers and obligated parties alike with a clearer view of expectations for 2026 and 2027. Unless biofuel production overshoots the thresholds for blending demand, or the EPA chooses not to reallocate a substantial volume of small refinery exemptions, market participants anticipate further continued strength for RIN prices. If these mandates do come to fruition and toughen the obligation refiners face for producing diesel, retooling and pivoting to a higher jet output would alleviate the added cost of producing finished road fuels.

            "title": "Viewpoint: Northeast diesel faces 2026 supply risks",
            "summary": "Houston, 30 December (Argus) — The US northeast diesel and heating oil market enters 2026 with lingering supply vulnerabilities despite recent improvements in flows. While imports of conventional fuels have resumed, structural constraints and global dynamics suggest that volatility will remain a defining feature in the coming years. Inventories of ultra-low sulphur diesel (ULSD) and ultra-low sulphur heating oil (ULSH) at the southern US Atlantic coast fell to the lowest level in more than 11-years this summer at 7.67mn bl. That pulled barrels sourced out of the US Gulf coast via the Colonial pipeline away from the line's final destination in the US northeast. New York Harbor's dependence on imports will persist due to limited refining capacity. While Canadian and Mexican flows improved late in 2025, upcoming refinery maintenance in Canada and operational uncertainties at Mexico's Olmeca refinery could disrupt supply in early 2026. Canadian refiner Suncor began 15 weeks of maintenance on 11 December at its 137,000 b/d Montreal refinery in Quebec, according to an announcement filed with Association industrielle de l'Est de Montreal, a near-term risk for US northeast markets. US imports from Canada nearly halved on the month in October, according to Vortexa ship-tracking data, partially caused by a turnaround at Irving Oil's 320,000 b/d St John refinery that ended in November. Following the turnaround, US Atlantic coast imports of ULSD and ULSH were 134,000 b/d, nearly double the level from a year earlier. Multiple cargoes came from Irving's St John refinery, according to Kpler ship-tracking data. But upcoming refinery work may once again come into play. Mexico's state-owned Pemex's 340,000 b/d Olmeca refinery recently resumed exports to the US after a near six-month period of zero loadings. Olmeca was initially highlighted as a crucial element in the Mexican government's strategy for road fuel self-sufficiency. But Pemex has also explored profitable ULSD export opportunities as local infrastructure has had difficulties absorbing the road fuel output from the Olmeca facility. Medium-range tanker BW Wren loaded around 300,000 bl of ULSD at the Dos Bocas port on 22 November and discharged throughout the southern US Atlantic coast, according to Kpler data. European diesel demand, amplified by sanctions on Russian products, kept open the US arbitrage to the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA) hub for much of 2025. If this trend continues, Gulf coast exports to Europe could again constrain diesel flows to the Atlantic coast. In the longer term, Nigeria's planned Dangote refinery expansion — scheduled for 2028 — may ease European demand for US barrels, but competition for supply will remain intense until then. Even though the US Atlantic coast remains heavily reliant on domestic and imported cargoes, the fungibility of diesel and heating oil grades provides leeway for sourcing these barrels. In mid-December, stockpiles of ULSD and ULSH at the central US Atlantic coast were down by 27pc on the year at 12.8mn bl, US Energy Information Administration data shows. Cash differentials that trade against the underlying Nymex basis — often a benchmark for regional demand — fell to 14-month and two-year lows during this period. Weaker demand for conventional diesel and heating oil in the New York region is partly driven by the growing availability and market share of B99 biodiesel. Three states across the northeast, including New York, are actively promoting biofuels adoption through legislative measures, tax incentives and infrastructure investments aimed at reducing emissions in heating systems and commercial transportation. The state of New York this year doubled its heating oil blend mandate to 10pc biodiesel (B10), while Connecticut and Rhode Island have similar B10 and B20 mandates, respectively. While biofuels help offset reduced inventories of conventional fuels, New York Harbor B99 biodiesel differentials to heating oil have traded at a premium for the first quarter 2026 because of feedstock and supply constraints, weaker credit incentives and policy uncertainty. Federal biofuel blending mandates for 2026 and 2027 remain unsettled, leading some producers to idle operations heading into the new year as they await clearer direction. In the short term, softer demand and renewed import flows suggest improved supply security for the US Atlantic coast. However, evolving federal policies and shifting global dynamics ensure that volatility will remain a hallmark of the region's diesel market.

            "title": "Diesel, jet cracks surpass $40/bl on Ice gasoil jump",
            "summary": "London, 19 November (Argus) — European diesel and jet fuel refining margins hit their widest in over two years on 18 November, following an unexpectedly strong rally in Ice gasoil futures. The premium of diesel cargoes on a fob ARA basis against benchmark North Sea Dated crude rose by $4.83/bl on the day to $43.64/bl on 18 November, the highest since January 2023. The premium of jet fuel cargoes on a cif northwest European basis against North Sea Dated rose by $3.87/bl to $41.19/bl, the highest since September 2023. Outright prices for both products were the highest for five months. This came after Ice gasoil futures — the underlying value in Argus ' European middle distillate assessments — firmed significantly. The front-month contract settled at $777.50/t, surging by $33.75/t or 4.5pc on the day. Market participants pointed to tight supplies that have been supporting margins in October and November. Diesel supply is particularly pressured, they noted, with fewer barrels on the water heading for Europe. Supply tightness has persisted for some weeks, with middle distillate cracks holding above $30/bl since 23 October. Middle distillate loadings for the EU, UK and Norway fell to an eight-month low in October of just 5.41mn t, according to Kpler, dropping by more than 30pc on the month. The arbitrages for diesel towards Europe from the US and Mideast Gulf held shut for most of October, according to traders. Heavy refinery maintenance in recent weeks has also tightened middle distillate supplies. Over 800,000 b/d of crude distillation capacity was offline in Europe over the past month, according to Argus tracking, but that peak has probably passed. Turnarounds in the Middle East and Asia-Pacific have weighed further on global supply. The backwardation in Ice gasoil futures — where prompt prices are at a premium to future prices — also steepened sharply on 18 November. The front-month contract settled at a $43.25/t premium to the second-month, wider on the day by $13.75/t. That premium has averaged $30.27/t so far this month, the highest monthly average since October 2022, if sustained until the end of November. The steep backwardation is likely to have incentivised firms to draw physical stocks down to very low levels, as gasoil unnecessarily left in tanks loses value quickly in a backwardated market. Diesel tanks are almost dry in ARA, and were drawn down more this week, according to market participants today. The backwardation also harms arbitrage economics, particularly for cargoes heading to Europe from the Mideast Gulf via the Cape of Good Hope. But several participants said middle distillate margins have risen beyond levels supported by fundamentals, and that supply constraints are not sufficiently severe to sustain values at current levels. This may explain why the Ice December gasoil contract fell by $11.25/t today to $768.25/t, although it traded as high as $804.50/t earlier in the day.

This may explain why the Ice December gasoil contract fell by $11.25/t today to $768.25/t, although it traded as high as $804.50/t earlier in the day.\n\nBy Amaar Khan and Josh Michalowski",

            "summary": "New York, 12 November (Argus) — Freight rates for refined oil products shipments loading onto medium range (MR) tankers in the US Gulf coast are rising on unusually strong demand from Caribbean and east coast Mexican buyers ahead of the growing US military deployment north of Venezuela. A charterer put an MR tanker on subjects for a US Gulf coast-Caribbean voyage at $875,000 lumpsum on Wednesday, nearly doubling from a near six-month low hit on 5 November at $440,000. Charterers put at least 18 MR tankers on subjects for US Gulf coast-loading voyages on 11 November alone, an exceptionally high amount of physical activity for the region and representing nearly 6mn bl of refined product demand from a single trading day. For comparison, the US Gulf coast exported 2.3mn b/d refined products in August, according to US Energy Information Administration data. The \"majority of\" these voyages were for \"short-haul runs\", according to a shipbroker. Buyers throughout the region may be concerned about supply disruptions if US military operations offshore Venezuela and Colombia escalate. The US Navy confirmed that the Gerald R. Ford carrier strike group reached Caribbean waters on 11 November, and that the strike group was comprised of the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier, two guided-missile destroyers and an integrated air and missile defense command ship. The carrier group is joining an amphibious ready group (ARG) that had been sitting southeast of Puerto Rico since 2 September, according to the US Navy's fleet tracker. The ARG is comprised of flagship USS Iwo Jima and two amphibious transport dock ships, the stated mission of which is to \"safely embark Marines ashore\". US president Donald Trump has suggested that airstrikes on Venezuela are a possibility ahead of the build-up of US naval forces in the region. The military operation is ostensibly focused on striking designated narco-terrorists in international waters, which the Pentagon said it has done seven times off the coast of Venezuela and twice near Colombia's Pacific coast by late October. Meanwhile, Colombian president Gustavo Petro announced the end of intelligence sharing with the US on Wednesday. Petro has called the US attacks on boats operating within Caribbean waters illegal. Colombia's Pozos Colorados port was the third most active destination port for US Gulf coast-loading refined products in the last 12 months, behind only the ports of Coatzacoalcos and Tuxpan on Mexico's east coast, according to Vortexa data. Buyers in Pozos imported 3pc of all US Gulf coast-loading products in that time, averaging 82,000 b/d. Caribbean buyers are the single largest drivers of demand by shipping region for US Gulf coast refined product exports, averaging a plurality of 22.2pc of all shipments at 580,200 b/d in the last 12 months, according to Vortexa. A flare-up in military activity and potential US strikes on mainland targets launched from the region could further disrupt flows to Panama, Bahamas, Honduras and Costa Rica among other countries in the region.

            "title": "Spot jet fuel prices weaken on US flight reductions",
            "summary": "Houston, 11 November (Argus) — US jet fuel prices fell against the diesel futures market today as US airports continue to face thousands of flight cancellations and delays, even as the US House of Representatives prepares to vote on a bill that would end the government shutdown that has disrupted air travel. The jet fuel market has been volatile as lower prompt demand clashed with Nymex futures prices that are being driven higher by optimism over a possible end to the shutdown, today on its 42nd day. The Argus US jet fuel index rose by 2.88¢/USG to $2.44/USG as declines in cash differentials failed to offset the gains seen in the Nymex ultra-low sulphur diesel (ULSD) contract, which establishes a base price for all distillates prices, including jet fuel. The index had already jumped by more than 5¢/USG on Monday though cash differentials were mostly steady after news the US Senate had voted 60-40 on Sunday night to begin debate on a Republican-backed bill that would fund most of the federal government through 30 January. But US Gulf coast jet fuel prices fell by 10.5¢/USG against Nymex week-on-week through today, while US west coast prices decreased by 9.25¢/USG on expectations of continued restrictions on travel in the near-term. Cancellations continue The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) last week mandated flight reductions of up to 10pc across 40 high-traffic airports, to be ramped up through the remainder of this week, in response to a shortage in air traffic controllers willing to work without pay. More than 1,200 US flights were cancelled and another 2,630 were delayed as of 4:30pm ET today, bringing the tally to 10,208 cancellations and 69,100 delays since 1 November, according flight-tracking site FlightAware. The count also includes mechanical, weather-related, and other incidents. Although the FAA order required reductions of only 6pc by today before ramping up to 8pc by 13 November and 10pc by 14 November, some airports were showing much higher percentages — presumably a partial result of differences in staffing across the nation. New York's LaGuardia airport was the hardest hit today, cancelling 65 outbound flights and 64 inbound flights, or 11pc of total traffic, FlightAware data show. Roughly 35pc of the remaining outbound flights were delayed today, along with 40pc of inbound flights. New York Harbor jet fuel decreased by 1.375¢/USG today, partially reversing a near 6¢/USG gain against Nymex seen Monday after setting a 2.5-month low at -18¢/USG on the first day of the FAA reductions on 7 November. Today's price still reflects a 12.5¢/USG decrease compared to the same day last week. Chicago jet fuel meanwhile fell by 5¢/USG against Nymex ULSD futures today to a 15¢/USG discount — its widest discount to the basis since 15 September. The city's O'Hare International Airport reported the second-largest volume of total cancellations today at 64 outbound and 57 inbound flights. The airport's reduction percentage fell short of the 6pc mandate by one percentage point, though it also experienced delays in 9pc of outbound flights and 8pc of inbound flights. \"Today has been a much better day,\" said US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy in a press conference today, referencing hundreds of air traffic controllers who have returned to work — a day after US president Donald Trump threatened to dock pay for those who do not. Duffy did not provide a concrete timeline for rolling back flight reductions. \"We're going to wait to see the data on our end before we take out the restrictions on travel — the 6pc we have right now,\" he said. \"It depends on air traffic controllers coming back on work.\" Air traffic controllers returning to work can expect to receive 70pc of their back pay within 24-48 hours of the government re-opening, Duffy said.

            "summary": "Mexico City, 11 November (Argus) — The volume of cargo handled by Mexican airports fell in September from the previous year, driven by a decrease in the volumes at Felipe Angeles International (AIFA) and Queretaro Intercontinental (AIQ) airports. Mexico's airports handled 30.03 metric tonnes of cargo in September, down by 5pc from 31.53t the previous year, according to Argus calculations using the latest data by civil aviation authority AFAC. Cargo throughput at AIFA, which took over cargo operations from AICM two years ago, fell by 14pc to 31.08t in September, down from 35.99t in the same month a year earlier. Meanwhile, AIQ's cargo volumes dropped by 17pc to 5.04t, down from 6.10t in September 2024. By contrast, cargo throughput at Mexico City's main airport (AICM) rose by 3pc to 20.65t, up from 19.98t the year before. Just over two years ago, Mexico shifted all cargo operations AICM to AIFA, a move that drew criticism from logistics operators over higher costs and longer transit times. The government said the measure was aimed at reducing congestion at AICM and boosting AIFA's role as a strategic hub. Since then, the government has reviewed moving some cargo operations back to AICM, but the majority remains at AIFA. From January-October, Mexico's airports handled 897.37t of cargo, down by 4pc from 93.94t the same period in 2024. A slowdown in Mexico's economic growth and uncertainty brought on by US president Donald Trump's tariff threats toward Mexico are factors behind the decrease, according to market sources. On 28 October, The US Department of Transportation (DOT) suspended all passenger flights between the US and AIFA and froze any expansion of international flights between the US and AICM, citing competition issues. In addition, the DOT is proposing a ban on cargo being transported on Mexican passenger flights between AICM and the US that would take effect 108 business days after the DOT gives the order. Tensions between the DOT and the Mexican government have escalated in recent years over Mexico's handling of air cargo operations and airport slot allocations. In 2023, Mexico began forcing all cargo-only airlines to relocate from AICM, the country's largest airport, to former president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's flagship AIFA. The government also reduced capacity at AICM, seizing slots from both US and Mexican airlines. The DOT said these actions were taken under false claims of congestion relief and noted that airlines were given only 108 business days' notice. Air cargo volumes are an indicator for jet fuel demand in Mexico. State-owned fuel supplier ASA sold 2.57mn bl (82,906 b/d) of jet fuel in August, down by 4pc from 2.66mn bl a year earlier, according to ASA data. September figures have not yet been released.

            "summary": "Updates total cancellations, delays. Houston, 7 November (Argus) — The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will stage planned flight cancellations over seven days before reaching a full 10pc reduction at key airports. A 4pc reduction in operations will take effect today at 40 high-traffic airports across the US before ramping up to 6pc by 11 November, 8pc by 13 November and 10pc by 14 November, according to the US Department of Transportation. Airlines will be allowed to use their own discretion to decide which flights are canceled to satisfy the order, which does not require a reduction in international flights. Total cancellations within, into or out of the US today reached 850 by 12pm ET today, according to flight-tracking site FlightAware, marking the highest rate month-to-date. Delays totaled 1,686. More than 660 cancellations are expected tomorrow, and at least 265 are planned for Sunday. US flight cancellations have totaled 1,875 since 1 November, and delays totaled 32,865. The count also includes mechanical, weather-related, and other incidents. US transportation secretary Sean Duffy had warned the US earlier this week that an extended US government shutdown would cause mass flight cancellations and airspace closures, blaming Democrats for not voting to reopen the government. Air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration (TSA) agents have been working without pay and with fewer staff since the partial US government shutdown started on 1 October. Staffing shortages prompted the FAA to periodically issue temporary ground stops at some airports because of a lack of air traffic controllers, while TSA staff shortages led to hours-long security check-ins.

            "summary": "Houston, 7 November (Argus) — The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will stage planned flight cancellations over seven days before reaching a full 10pc reduction at key airports. A 4pc reduction in operations will take effect today at 40 high-traffic airports across the US before ramping up to 6pc by 11 November, 8pc by 13 November and 10pc by 14 November, according to the US Department of Transportation. Airlines will be allowed to use their own discretion to decide which flights are canceled to satisfy the order, which does not require a reduction in international flights. US transportation secretary Sean Duffy had warned the US earlier this week that an extended US government shutdown would cause mass flight cancellations and airspace closures, blaming Democrats for not voting to reopen the government. Air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration (TSA) agents have been working without pay and with fewer staff since the partial US government shutdown started on 1 October. Staffing shortages prompted the FAA to periodically issue temporary ground stops at some airports because of a lack of air traffic controllers, while TSA staff shortages led to hours-long security check-ins. US flight cancellations have totaled 1,018 since 1 November, and delays totaled 30,147 by 8:40pm ET on 6 November, according to flight-tracking site FlightAware. The count also includes mechanical, weather-related, and other incidents. The planned flight reductions may add downward pressure to US jet fuel prices because of lower demand. The Argus US jet fuel index already fell by 22.6¢/USG week-on-week to $2.41/USG by the end of trade 6 November.
